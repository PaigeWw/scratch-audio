/**
* A pitch change effect, which changes the playback rate of the sound in order
* to change its pitch: reducing the playback rate lowers the pitch, increasing the rate
* raises the pitch. The duration of the sound is also changed.
*
* Changing the value of the pitch effect by 10 causes a change in pitch by 1 semitone
* (i.e. a musical half-step, such as the difference between C and C#)
* Changing the pitch effect by 120 changes the pitch by one octave (12 semitones)
*
* The value of this effect is not clamped (i.e. it is typically between -120 and 120,
* but can be set much higher or much lower, with weird and fun results).
* We should consider what extreme values to use for clamping it.
*
* Note that this effect functions differently from the other audio effects. It is
* not part of a chain of audio nodes. Instead, it provides a way to set the playback
* on one SoundPlayer or a group of them.
